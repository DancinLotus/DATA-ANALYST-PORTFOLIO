Hi my name is Farida and welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am a receent data analyst graduate with experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data to inform business decisions. I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills in different industries. It's still a work in progress, I'm trying to get a hand of how Github to properly display my projects. But for now please check out what I have uploaded so far. 

Thank You for your time!
